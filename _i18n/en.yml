        title: What is an open:bumble:space?
        body: The open:bumble:space is the place where the Munich User Group on the topic of 'Agile' gathers. We meet every two months for an Open Space. We know that agility is based on continuous learning. We believe that we learn better and faster when we share our experiences with each other, in an informal setting, not a lecture but ad hoc.

    text: We are bumbleflies
    body: |
      We are Chris, Chris again, and Sebastian, the bumbleflies. Our name is a nod to the two phenomena of Open Space: the bumblebees, representing the spread of ideas, and the butterflies, symbolizing the beautiful and unexpected. As part of the organizing team for the Open Space Scrum Munich event, we have gathered extensive experience and are ready to pass on this knowledge.

      With bumbleflies UG, we offer organizations support in the implementation of the Open Space format. We believe that Open Space is a powerful tool for collaboration and knowledge exchange and want to advance the idea together with you. That's why we not only offer the organization of Open Spaces, but also training and workshops to assist companies and organizations in implementing Open Space.

      We are convinced that everyone can benefit from the open and participatory working method that Open Space enables, and we look forward to sharing our passion for Open Space and an open, collaborative work culture with you.
