        body: The open:bumble:space is the place where the Munich User Group on the topic of 'Agile' gathers. We meet every two months for an Open Space. We know that agility is based on continuous learning. We believe that we learn better and faster when we share our experiences with each other, in an informal setting, not a lecture but ad hoc.

        body: "The Camper Coach Camp is like an [Agile Coach Camp](https://agilecoachcamp.org/), with the difference that we do not build on an existing location, but build it ourselves (through campers [and tents, etc.]). In other words, genuinely self-organized. But words are just words, better to look at the pictures to get an impression of what awaits you there. Just one thing in advance: it will blow you away!"
      schedule:
        title: What can I expect at the Camp?
        body: |
          The Agile Camper Coach Camp Europe (ACCCEU) is not just another Agile Coach Camp – it's a unique experience of self-organization and collaboration. Imagine a camp where you not only share your knowledge and experiences but also design the very place where it happens. Through campers, tents, and the community of participants, a dynamic environment is created that embodies the principles of agility and self-organization.
      
          #### Arrival and Setup
          Start the day by setting up your camper or tent and get to know other enthusiastic Agile Coaches.
          #### Open Space Kickoff
          Once everyone is settled in, we kick off with an Open Space introduction where every participant can suggest topics and plan sessions.
          #### Self-organized Sessions
          Throughout the day, there are multiple slots for sessions that are organized and led by the participants themselves. This can range from workshops to discussions to hands-on exercises.
          #### Networking and Relaxation
          Use the breaks between sessions to connect with other participants, enjoy the beautiful surroundings of the "Wanderheaven" campsite, or simply relax.
          #### Conclusion and Reflection
          At the end of the day, all participants come together to share their experiences, provide feedback, and reflect on what they've learned.
      
          The Agile Camper Coach Camp offers a perfect blend of learning, networking, and nature. It's an opportunity to dive deep into the world of agile coaching while simultaneously experiencing the freedom and adventure of camping life. Be ready to be amazed and let this unique experience inspire you!

          We are happy to announce that we, as bumbleflies, were allowed to translate the [current FaST-Guide](https://www.fastagile.io/fast-guide) from English into German.
          
          Fluid Scaling Technology combines Open Space Technology and Open Allocation into a lightweight, easy to understand and easy to master, scalable method for organizing people around work.
          The Open Space format can be used in many situations. You can use it standalone, for example, to solve complex, potentially conflicting problems with a diverse group, or embedded in larger models, such as Open Space Agility or Open Space Beta.
          
          FaST-Agile is an example of embedding and interacting Open Space in a specific context. Fluid Scaling Technology combines Open Space Technology and Open Allocation into a lightweight, easy to understand and easy to master, scalable method for organizing people around work.

          This two-day, in-person, instructor-led, activity-based class is geared to deeply understanding Fluid Scaling Technology (FAST). It will cover FAST's what, why, and how, including how to start and common pitfalls to avoid.

          The style of this class will follow a plan but not in a highly controlled or structured way. Instead, we will allow for the group's interests and needs to determine the content and pace - and allow for emergence.

      We are Chris, Chris again, and Sebastian, the bumbleflies. Our name is a nod to the two phenomena of Open Space: the bumblebees, representing the spread of ideas, and the butterflies, symbolizing the beautiful and unexpected. As part of the organizing team for the Open Space Scrum Munich event, we have gathered extensive experience and are ready to pass on this knowledge.

      With bumbleflies UG, we offer organizations support in the implementation of the Open Space format. We believe that Open Space is a powerful tool for collaboration and knowledge exchange and want to advance the idea together with you. That's why we not only offer the organization of Open Spaces, but also training and workshops to assist companies and organizations in implementing Open Space.

      We are convinced that everyone can benefit from the open and participatory working method that Open Space enables, and we look forward to sharing our passion for Open Space and an open, collaborative work culture with you.
