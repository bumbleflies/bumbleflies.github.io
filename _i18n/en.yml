          *A retreat is a planned period of time away from one's usual routine, often in a quiet or peaceful setting, to evolve.*
  
          At bumbleflies, we understand that organizing team retreats can be challenging. Different ideas and needs within the organizing team can lead to conflicts that prolong the process and cause dissatisfaction. That's why we are excited to introduce our new product: bumble:retreat.

          body: |
            The Agile Camper Coach Camp Europe (ACCCEU) is not just another Agile Coach Camp – it's a unique experience of self-organization and collaboration. Imagine a camp where you not only share your knowledge and experiences but also create the place where it happens. Through campers, tents, and the community of participants, a dynamic environment emerges that embodies the principles of agility and self-organization.
    
            #### Arrival and Setup
            Start the day by setting up your camper or tent and get to know other enthusiastic Agile Coaches.
            #### Open Space Opening
            Once everyone is settled in, we kick off with an Open Space opening where every participant can propose topics and plan sessions.
            #### Self-Organized Sessions
            Throughout the day, there are multiple slots for sessions organized and led by the participants. These can range from workshops to discussions to hands-on activities.
            #### Networking and Relaxation
            Use the breaks between sessions to network with other participants, enjoy the beautiful surroundings of the "Wanderheaven" campsite, or simply relax.
            #### Closing and Reflection
            At the end of the day, all participants come together to share their experiences, give feedback, and reflect on what they've learned.
    
            The Agile Camper Coach Camp offers a perfect combination of learning, networking, and nature. It's an opportunity to dive deep into the world of agile coaching while experiencing the freedom and adventure of camping life. Be prepared to be impressed and inspired by this unique experience!

            # The Idea
            The idea was born at a party in 2019. Yes, it was after midnight and yes, it was in the kitchen ;). From then on, the idea spread, gained more followers, and finally, in September 2020, the [first #accceu](https://x.com/hashtag/accceu) took place at a cozy little campsite in northern Bavaria.
            The idea was very happy with this event, felt comfortable and cozy, and took a little nap, hibernated, and grew. In 2023, it decided to wake up again, fresh and beautiful as ever, and so the [second #accceu](/agiles-camper-coach-camp-23) took place in 2023. The organizers and participants had changed a bit, but the idea was still the same. It liked Turkey so much that after the event it decided to sleep again for a while, but not too long. And so it was decided to repeat the #accceu in 2024. And since the idea is European, we looked for another country.
            # What does the idea look like?
            The idea is as simple as it is beautiful. Since this profession has existed, Agile Coaches have been meeting at unconferences. These unconferences are often called camps. So if we meet in camps to openly discuss all aspects of Agile Coaching, why not do it while camping? The idea was to come together at a campsite, have open spaces there, talk about our passion (Agile Coaching or whatever moves us), but also cook, eat, talk, laugh, think, and whatever else should happen together. Open Space says whoever comes are the right people, and whatever happens is exactly what is supposed to happen.

          We are happy to announce that we, as bumbleflies, were allowed to translate the [current FaST-Guide](https://www.fastagile.io/guide){:target="_blank"} from English into German.
          
          Fluid Scaling Technology combines Open Space Technology and Open Allocation into a lightweight, easy to understand and easy to master, scalable method for organizing people around work.
          The Open Space format can be used in many situations. You can use it standalone, for example, to solve complex, potentially conflicting problems with a diverse group, or embedded in larger models, such as Open Space Agility or Open Space Beta.
          
          FaST-Agile is an example of embedding and interacting Open Space in a specific context. Fluid Scaling Technology combines Open Space Technology and Open Allocation into a lightweight, easy to understand and easy to master, scalable method for organizing people around work.

        body: |
          This two-day, in-person, instructor-led, activity-based class is geared to deeply understanding Fluid Scaling Technology (FAST). It will cover FAST's what, why, and how, including how to start and common pitfalls to avoid.

          The style of this class will follow a plan but not in a highly controlled or structured way. Instead, we will allow for the group's interests and needs to determine the content and pace - and allow for emergence.

    text: We are bumbleflies
    body: |
      We are Chris, Chris again, and Sebastian, the bumbleflies. Our name is a nod to the two phenomena of Open Space: the bumblebees, representing the spread of ideas, and the butterflies, symbolizing the beautiful and unexpected. As part of the organizing team for the Open Space Scrum Munich event, we have gathered extensive experience and are ready to pass on this knowledge.

      With bumbleflies UG, we offer organizations support in the implementation of the Open Space format. We believe that Open Space is a powerful tool for collaboration and knowledge exchange and want to advance the idea together with you. That's why we not only offer the organization of Open Spaces, but also training and workshops to assist companies and organizations in implementing Open Space.

      We are convinced that everyone can benefit from the open and participatory working method that Open Space enables, and we look forward to sharing our passion for Open Space and an open, collaborative work culture with you.
